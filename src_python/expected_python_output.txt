['cooking spray', '2 pounds ground turkey', '1 (10 ounce) box frozen chopped spinach, thawed and squeezed dry', '4 ounces feta cheese', '2 large eggs, beaten', '2 cloves garlic, minced']
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.
Mix together turkey, spinach, feta, eggs, and garlic in a large bowl until well combined; form into 8 patties.
Cook patties on the preheated grill on both sides until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of patties should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
